# Color Blind Dark

A simple dark `color theme` for `Visual Studio Code` for those with color blindness. This theme makes all text white with a black background.

Whilst editors using various colors for language syntax is helpful, for some with color blindness it can make it harder to read instead of easier.

Most of the existing Visual Studio Code color blind themes appear to include using a mixture of colors. Thus I made this theme to remove the coloring entirely and simply make all text white.
